# Fraud_Detection

Fraudulent activities, whether initiated through phone calls, emails, or face-to-face interactions, pose a significant threat to individuals on a daily basis. Recognizing the warning signs of scams is crucial in safeguarding against financial losses. In this project, I aim to develop a predictive model to ascertain whether a fraud incident results in monetary loss. I am using a dataset from the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, specifically the [Fraud Reporting System database](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/6a09c998-cddb-4a22-beff-4dca67ab892f), which gathers reports from different places, including online submissions by people. The data spans from 2021 to 2023. All the files for this project are available for [download](https://github.com/DorisKJ/Fraud_Detection).
